🌱 Sustainability Note
This project was assisted by ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI.
You might have heard that using AI consumes water — and that's partly true.

Like many cloud-based services, AI models run on servers in large data centers. These centers require cooling to operate efficiently, and one method involves water-based cooling systems.

🔍 According to a 2023 study, using a language model like ChatGPT may indirectly consume around 500 ml of water per 10 to 50 prompts, due to data center cooling.

While this project may have indirectly used a few liters of water during development, it's important to highlight that:

OpenAI and other tech companies are actively working to improve energy and water efficiency.

Many data centers are transitioning toward renewable energy and greener cooling systems.

🌿 Let’s stay informed and responsible as we build and use AI-powered tools.
